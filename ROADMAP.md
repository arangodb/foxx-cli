# Roadmap to 1.0.0

The following still needs work before this module can become a "1.0" release:

## General stuff

* :question: Document all commands in README?
* :question: Create `man` pages for \*nix?
* :book: Document foxxignore format in-app (`help foxxignore`?)
* :book: Document foxxrc format in-app (`help foxxrc`?)

## `init` (post-1.0)

* Actually generate files and folders
* Implement example routes (`generateExamples`)
* Define meaningful "minimal" defaults
* Define meaningful "full" defaults
