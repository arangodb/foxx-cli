## [Unpublished]

## [1.2.0] - 2018-06-26

### Added

* Option `--password-file` (alias `-p`) reads the password from a file

  This is an alternative to `--password` which is interactive for security reasons.

## [1.1.3] - 2018-04-18

### Fixed

* Fixed `foxx init`: generateCrudRoutes is not defined (#27)

## [1.1.2] - 2018-04-11

### Fixed

* `foxx bundle` warning when outfile already exists now shows correct path

* `foxx init -i` only adds routers to `index.js` when generating CRUD routers

  This fixes a bug where defining collections without also generating CRUD routers
  would still result in the routers being referenced in `index.js` leading to a
  broken service.

* Foxx CLI now follows symlinks when generating the service bundle

## [1.1.1] - 2018-04-10

### Fixed

* Re-released on Linux to fix bad linebreaks in `foxx` CLI command

## [1.1.0] - 2018-04-10

### Added

* `foxx init` makes it easy to create boilerplate for a Foxx service.

* `foxx add` allows generating various JavaScript files:

  * `foxx add script` generates a script and adds it to the manifest

  * `foxx add test` generates a test suite

  * `foxx add router` generates a router and registers it in the main file

  * `foxx add crud` generates a CRUD router for a collection

## [1.0.1] - 2018-03-22

### Fixed

* HTTPS URLs are now resolved correctly

  Foxx CLI now uses the `request` module to download service sources locally.

## [1.0.0] - 2018-03-21
